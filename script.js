// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the user’s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.
function applyPreferences() { // Function command that retrieves and applies user preferences over from local storage
    const name = localStorage.getItem('name'); // Retrieves the 'name' from local storage using the "const" command
    const backgroundColor = localStorage.getItem('background-color'); // Retrieves the 'background-color' from local storage using the "const" command
    const foregroundColor = localStorage.getItem('foreground-color'); // Retrieves the 'foreground-color' from local storage using the "const" command
